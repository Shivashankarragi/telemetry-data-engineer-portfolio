# telemetry-data-engineer-portfolio
This repository showcases a collection of professional-grade data engineering, analytics, and applied machine learning projects. With 4+ years of experience in software engineering, I focus on building scalable data solutions that bridge deep technical expertise with business impact.

The projects in this repo reflect end-to-end workflows, including:

Data Engineering: Designing and implementing robust ETL/ELT pipelines with Python and SQL, optimized for performance and scalability.

Data Modeling & Warehousing: Structuring data for analytical workflows and efficient query performance.

Workflow Orchestration: Automating pipelines with tools like Airflow, Luigi, or custom schedulers.

Exploratory & Diagnostic Analysis: Gaining actionable insights from structured and unstructured datasets.

Machine Learning Applications: Applying predictive and classification models on real-world datasets.

Best Practices: Maintaining clean code, reproducibility, and proper documentation.

These projects are not academic exercises; they are designed to mimic real-world data challenges that align with modern industry practices. The datasets used include both open-source and custom-simulated data inspired by domains such as telematics, IoT, and enterprise analytics.

This repository also reflects my ability to integrate past experience in embedded software and system-level programming into the data domain. By combining low-level engineering rigor with advanced data practices, I bring a unique perspective on solving complex problems at scale.
